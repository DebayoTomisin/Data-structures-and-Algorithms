It is important to put the important stuffs on paper, what this entails is creating flowcharts and pseudocode. This helps have clearer understanding 
of the flow of execution of the program.

#IDEAS

In designing flowcharts, we should follow the following guidelines

1. Write state and instruction steps in rectangles
2. Write decision steps in diamonds
3. connect sequential steps with arrows.
4. Mark the start and the end of the process or program.

Pseudocode:  Human friendly method of representing computer programs.

Mathematical Models: Models basically represents a problem and its characteristics. It is important to understand these models as they help to know
how a problem should be approached, either, quadractically, logarithmically, with graph theory etc. very important concept.


##LOGIC
In logic, variables and operators represent the validity of things rather than modelling numerical problems like in math.
For instance, the validity of the expression “if the pool is warm, I’ll swim” is based on two variables
A = the pool is warm
B = i swim
A -> B 

Dependency between variables is expressed with a conditional operator such as [!, ->, etc].

A contrapositive statement simply implies A-> B is the same !A -> !B, like in the example above, the pool is cold (!A) and i dont swim (!B)

BiConditional statement (A <--> B), in the example above,  this statement means i'll only swim if and only if the pool is warm.

AND, OR, Exclusive OR: These are the most popular logical operators around.
A = drank Wine
B = drank vodka

AND means dranked mixed drinks
OR means you drank, whether mixed or now
ExOR means You didn't mix the drinks but drank.
