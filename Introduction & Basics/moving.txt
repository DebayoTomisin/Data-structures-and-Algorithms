Main strategies for Algorithm Design:

1. Iteration: Algorithms that require double the operations if the input size increases by a single item are exponential
2. Recursion: Using Recursion requires seeing how low a problem can beb stated in terms of itself. The key to understanding recursion and how it works is to find th base case
    What is the smallest form of the problem you're trying to solve.
